# API

## Introduction

This repository holds the API.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
make install_dev
```

If you want to commit changes to `scripts`,
you need to install ShellCheck, e.g. with:

```shell
brew install shellcheck
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the values.

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

### Database Setup

Start the database:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

Upon API startup the database will be automatically migrated.
It can be done manually using:

```shell
alembic upgrade head
```

Then populate the database. E.g., from the `Pipelines` repository.
You need to add a user to the database with `python scripts/add_test_user.py`.

### Start the API

Launch the API:

```shell
# Adding `--debug` will refresh the API upon code changes.
api --debug
```

## Security

### Authentication

Authentication is done with basic authentication.
This needs to be replaced by a more secure mechanism for any real world usage.

### Authorization

Authorization with a role-based access control (RBAC) system.

### File Server

To share a file hosted on GCS, the API uses signed URLs.
This means that the API will generate a URL that is only valid for a limited time.
One needs to be authenticated to generate a signed URL.
This should not be used for confidential documents.

## Database

In GCP Cloud SQL, if you are connecting to a database using the private IP method, you can specify a Unix domain socket path instead of using a traditional TCP connection.

Azure Database Services (e.g., Azure Database for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server) primarily use TCP/IP connections instead of Unix sockets.

Hence, in `api/api/utils/database.py` if using Azure, remove the code below (and the corresponding config variables):

```python
if config.environment:
    return (
        f"{db_config.dialect}://"
        f"{db_config.username}:{db_config.password}@/"
        f"{db_config.db_name}"
        f"?unix_sock={db_config.unix_socket_path}"
    )
```
